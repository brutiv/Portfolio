This is a small personal portfolio website built with plain HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

What's in this repo
- `index.html` — main page (Work, Experience, Metrics)
- `projects.html`, `spectra.html`, `validex.html`, `stats.html` — project and stats pages
- `contact.html` — contact page with a prominent email CTA
- `styles.css` — site styles (black & white minimalist theme)
